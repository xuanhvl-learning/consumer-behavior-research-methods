## 📖 Methods Overview

### Qualitative Methods
Methods for deep, contextual understanding of consumer behavior:
- **[Heuristics Research](qualitative-methods/heuristics-research/)** - Understanding decision-making shortcuts
- **Focus Groups** - Group discussions and dynamics
- **Ethnographic Studies** - Observational research in natural settings
- **In-Depth Interviews** - One-on-one detailed conversations

### Quantitative Methods
Methods for statistical analysis and measurement:
- **[Price Elasticity](quantitative-methods/price-elasticity/)** - Measuring price sensitivity
- **Conjoint Analysis** - Understanding product preferences
- **Choice Modeling** - Predicting consumer choices
- **Regression Analysis** - Identifying relationships between variables
